## A Neutral landscapes example for lattice wombling

First we create a 50 x 50 'cell' landscape. In this
instance a planar landscape is it has a 'distinct'/sharp
boundary

````julia
using NeutralLandscapes
siz = 50, 50
A = Matrix(rand(EdgeGradient(), siz))
````

Plot the landscape so we have an _a priori_ idea
of what if looks like

````julia
plot(heatmap(A))

Calculate the rate of change (ùëÄ) and direction of
change (Œ∏) using `wombling()`

````julia
womble = wombling(A)

plot(
    plot(heatmap(womble.M), title = "Rate of Change"),
    plot(heatmap(womble.Œò), title = "Direction of Change")
    )

savefig("assets/PlanarWomble.png")
````

We can extract the candidate boundaries using the
rate of change caluclated from `wombling()`

````julia
boundary = boundaries(womble.M)

plot(
    heatmap(boundary),
    title = "Candidate boundaries"
)
